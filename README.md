# Introduction
Hello there. *sshb* allows you to manage your ssh bookmarks with a basic YAML file and connect to them smoothly with auto-complete. Basically, you do not need to remember any hostnames, IPs etc. while sshing. Please be careful when using *sshb* on production environments. This project is not completely tested right now.

## To-do
- [ ] Installation guide and "sshb.yaml" documentation/examples.
- [ ] Source code documentation.
- [ ] Test cases.
